# Getting started

- Run yarn install or npm install
- Run yarn start or npm run start
- Navigate to http://localhost:1234

# Testing

- Home page shows top events from /home call
- Each sport page in side menu is top events for the sport
- click an event title to go to details page

# Things to know

- I prioritized showing how I would build the app and solving a couple of the problems you had to solve for example the layout based on data and responsive grid design
- Create react app was not used (though I have used it a million times before) because of a bug that was keeping me from using it. (more details at: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/8771)
- Including time spent wasted on create react app this took me about a full work day.
- This is was my first time using parcel. If you run into any issues let me know and I will try to help.
